It was created in Canada by Glen Warren Productions and partially funded by Twentieth Century Fox, who now own the broadcast and syndication rights to the series. It was also compiled down into five movies, each composed of two episodes each, with new credit sequences. The series was written by renowned science fiction author Harlan Ellison under a pseudonym of Cordwainer Bird, with additional episodes being written by other sci-fi authors. The plot concerned a giant Noah's Ark-like spaceship, composed of hundreds of huge \"domes\", each containing a sample culture from the planet Earth, which has long since died out due to an unknown disaster. The Ark, damaged from an asteroid collision, goes off course and heads into the path of a distant sun, its crew dead.</p><p>Foreseeing the destruction of the Earth, humanity builds a multi-generational starship called Earthship Ark, 80 kilometres (50 mi) wide and 320 kilometres (200 mi) long. The ship contains dozens of biospheres, each kilometres across and housing people of different cultures; their goal is to find and seed a new world of a distant star. More than one hundred years into the voyage, an unexplained accident occurs, and the ship goes into emergency mode, whereby each biosphere is sealed off from the others.<br>Four hundred and five years after the accident, Devon (Keir Dullea) a resident of Cypress Corners, a conservative agrarian community with a culture resembling that of the Amish, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. Considered an outcast because of his questioning of the way things are, especially his refusal to accept the arranged marriage of his love Rachel (Gay Rowan) to his friend Garth (Robin Ward), Devon finds the Cypress Corners elders have been deliberately manipulating the local computer terminal, which they call \"The Voice of The Creator\". The congregation pursues Devon for attacking the elders and stealing a computer cassette on which they have recorded their orders, and its leaders plot to execute him, but the elderly Abraham, who also questions the elders, gives Devon a key to a dark, mysterious doorway, which Abraham himself is afraid to enter. The frightened Devon escapes into the service areas of the ship and accesses a computer data station that explains the nature and purpose of the Ark and hints at its problems.<br>When Devon returns to Cypress Corners to tell his community what he has learned, he is put on trial for heresy and condemned to death by stoning. Escaping on the night before his execution with the aid of Garth, Devon convinces Rachel to come with him, and Garth pursues them. When Rachel refuses to return with Garth, he joins her and Devon. Eventually they make their way to the ship's bridge, containing the skeletal remains of its crew. It is badly damaged and its control systems are inoperative. The three discover that the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun, and realize that the only way to save The Ark and its passengers is to find the backup bridge and reactivate the navigation and propulsion systems. Occasionally, they are aided by the ship's partially functioning computer system.</p>","updated":1465618204,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1752"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/152354"}}},{"id":1753,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1753/jonathan-creek","name":"Jonathan Creek","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime","Mystery"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"1997-05-10","officialSite":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008jg9q","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":7.6},"weight":53,"network":{"id":12,"name":"BBC One","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":4073,"thetvdb":75033,"imdb":"tt0118363"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/9/24490.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/9/24490.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Working from his home in a converted windmill, <b>Jonathan Creek</b> is a magician with a natural ability for solving puzzles.

But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience.</p><p>This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him.</p><p>Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside.</p>","updated":1602252281,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1828"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1872555"}}},{"id":1829,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1829/psychic-matchmaker","name":"Psychic Matchmaker","type":"Reality","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Running","runtime":30,"premiered":"2015-05-01","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"22:30","days":[]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":0,"network":{"id":80,"name":"TLC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":43681,"thetvdb":295295,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/302/755209.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/302/755209.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Love is all about finding the perfect connection, and according to psychic Deborah Graham, that connection is a subconscious link that lives inside a person's soul.

Trying to keep the peace on the streets is police officer Lex Carnahan, who has quickly risen through the ranks of the Atlanta PD. But Lex's job becomes even harder when he learns that his longtime girlfriend, Jana, and his best friend and fellow officer Jake, are trapped within the cordoned area. Also quarantined in viral ground zero is 17 year-old Teresa, who is eight months pregnant and now separated from her boyfriend on the other side; Katie Frank, an elementary school teacher now placed on lockdown with her entire class, including her young son; and CDC researcher Dr. Victor Cannerts, the doctor who initially made the controversial call to quarantine the area and is now racing to find a cure for the virus. On the outside, Dr. Sabine Lommers is leading the government efforts to contain the outbreak, and has asked for Lex's help in enforcing the cordon - which grows increasingly difficult as the public trust deteriorates. And the public has reason to be wary, as journalist Leo begins unraveling a conspiracy, finding that something doesn't add up in the official story being told. Torn apart from their loved ones, the survivors trapped within the cordon are fighting against not only fatal infection, but also isolation, fear, and the disintegration of society around them. But as they begin to gain each other's trust, hope remains, and on either side of the cordon unlikely heroes will rise.</p>","updated":1585652234,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1861"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/852193"}}},{"id":1862,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1862/scream-queens","name":"Scream Queens","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Horror"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2015-09-22","officialSite":"http://www.fox.com/scream-queens","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Tuesday"]},"rating":{"average":7},"weight":0,"network":{"id":4,"name":"FOX","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":45726,"thetvdb":293302,"imdb":"tt4145384"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/85/213832.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/85/213832.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The girls of Kappa House are dying for new pledges. <b>Scream Queens</b> is a new killer comedy-horror series from Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, the Emmy- and Golden Globe Award-winning executive producers of Glee and American Horror Story.
